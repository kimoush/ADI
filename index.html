Keep in mind that amplifier power rating should match the subwoofer's rating to ensure high-performance and to avoid sound distortion.</p>

                        <p>The coverage angle of a speaker is the angle at which the speaker can produce sound at a given level. The coverage angle is affected by several factors, including the type of speaker, the size and type of driver and the crossover network. It's important to determine the coverage angle of a speaker so you'll know how the sound will be distributed in a room.</p>
